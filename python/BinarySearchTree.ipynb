    "## 6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "We can limit the number of iterations required for common operations like find, insert and update by organizing our data in the following structure, called a **binary tree**:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's called a tree because it vaguely like an inverted tree trunk with branches. \n",
    "* The word \"binary\" indicates that each \"node\" in the tree can have at most 2 children (left or right). \n",
    "* Nodes can have 0, 1 or 2 children. Nodes that do not have any children are sometimes also called \"leaves\".\n",
    "* The single node at the top is called the \"root\" node, and it typically where operations like search, insertion etc. begin.\n",

    "## Balanced Binary Search Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Mqef5b3.png\" width=\"520\">\n",
    "\n",
    "For our use case, we require the binary tree to have some additional properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keys and Values**: Each node of the tree stores a key (a username) and a value (a `User` object). Only keys are shown in the picture above for brevity. A binary tree where nodes have both a key and a value is often referred to as a **map** or **treemap** (because it maps keys to values).\n",
    "2. **Binary Search Tree**: The *left subtree* of any node only contains nodes with keys that are lexicographically smaller than the node's key, and the *right subtree* of any node only contains nodes with keys that lexicographically larger than the node's key. A tree that satisfies this property is called a **binary search trees**, and it's easy to locate a specific key by traversing a single path down from the root note.\n",
    "3. **Balanced Tree**: The tree is **balanced** i.e. it does not skew too heavily to one side or the other. The left and right subtrees of any node shouldn't differ in height/depth by more than 1 level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Height of a Binary Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of levels in a tree is called its height. As you can tell from the picture above, each level of a tree contains twice as many nodes as the previous level. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a tree of height `k`, here's a list of the number of nodes at each level:\n",
    "\n",
    "Level 0: `1`\n",
    "\n",
    "Level 1: `2`\n",
    "\n",
    "Level 2: `4` i.e. `2^2`\n",
    "\n",
    "Level 3: `8` i.e. `2^3`\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "Level k-1: `2^(k-1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "If the total number of nodes in the tree is `N`, then it follows that\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "N = 1 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can simplify this equation by adding `1` on each side:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "N + 1 = 1 + 1 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1) \n",
    "\n",
    "N + 1 = 2^1 + 2^1 + 2^2+ 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1) \n",
    "\n",
    "N + 1 = = 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "N + 1 = = 2^3 + 2^3 + ... + 2^(k-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "N + 1 = 2^(k-1) + 2^(k-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "N + 1 = 2^k\n",
    "\n",
    "k = log(N + 1) <= log(N) + 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, to store `N` records we require a balanced binary search tree (BST) of height no larger than `log(N) + 1`. This is a very useful property, in combination with the fact that nodes are arranged in a way that makes it easy to find a specific key by following a single path down from the root. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we'll see soon, the `insert`, `find` and `update` operations in a balanced BST have time complexity `O(log N)` since they all involve traversing a single path down from the root of the tree."
